# Quick Start

After building.

1.  Create a directory (documents is fine, or similar location) for your new project.
2.  Copy in an example yquill from ``share/examples``, rename it to `.yquill`` in your new directory (step #1)
3.  Edit ``.yquill`` parameters to suit your project
4.  Execute ``serverYQ <path-to-directory>``
5.  Navigate web-browser to ``http://localhost:25505`` (or whichever port number you decide to use)
    a.  Note, this *is* a web-server, so it'll be visible to everybody on your network.
