Geo is a template for earth-based geography (common).  Countries are the
two-letter internet code.  States/provinces are two-letter postal codes. 
It'll be assumed that "plot" is included, so classes will be accordingly.

Note, if your story is not earth centric, feel free to copy-n-paste these
into a sub-folder in your own project instead of chaining.
